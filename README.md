# Detecting the QR Code and Bar Code using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to detect QR codes and barcodes using OpenCV. It includes code, resources, and a step-by-step guide to set up and run the detection process.

## Features

- Detects QR codes and barcodes in images or video streams.
- Uses OpenCV for efficient computer vision processing.
- Easy-to-follow structure for extending or integrating with other projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy (if required)
- Any additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if included)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Detecting-QR-and-Bar-Code-OpenCV.git
   cd Detecting-QR-and-Bar-Code-OpenCV
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Add your input images or video streams in the designated folder (if applicable).
2. Run the detection script:

   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```

3. View results in the output folder or terminal (depending on implementation).
